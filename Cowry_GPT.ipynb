A shift in  \\nconsumer  expectations  has created  a demand  for more  personalised,  more  competitive  and \\nfaster services. However, an ever -decreasing consumer attention span continues to make it  \\nhard for brands to reach out and interact with consumers. With 68.8% of online baskets  \\nbeing  abandoned, this is no small feat.  \\nAs retail evolves, brands must find ways to create meaningful customer experiences.  \\nHowever, millions upon millions are investing in new digital infrastructure an d processes,  \\nunfortunately  with  no real consideration  for the customer.  Cowry  builds  a bridge  between  \\nyour company and brand, centred on the customer. We transform friction into ﬂuent  \\ninteractions.

Behavioural science can explain the behaviours that underpin these seemingly  \\nirrational choices. The classic insurance industry is built in a way which pits the insured  \\nagainst  the insurer,  fighting  over  the same  coin.  This culminates  in a vicious  cycle  of distrust,  \\nmaking  premiums go  up, and  turning claims  processes into  an ordeal.  \\n \\nAs the consumer evolves and established companies become vulnerable to startup  \\nchallengers,  the insurance  industry  must  evolve  to disrupt  and reinvent  the insurance  ', doc_id='fe1cf3ad-5e33-432f-aa9e-36146e0d473f', embedding=None, doc_hash='f203a0df0537e36a17c41963aac6ac8abe4a0e8b490823267fb02d3942f6a372', extra_info={'page_label': '1', 'file_name': 'cowry_merged.pdf'}),\n",

       " Document(text='What  is a Behavioral  Model?  \\nA behavioral  model  is a representation  of key factors  and constructs  within  a system.  It is \\nutilized  to describe  relevant  characteristics,  make  predictions,  and develop  interventions.  \\nWhile these models oﬀer valuable insights into subconscious decis ion-making processes,  \\nthey are not perfect descriptions of behavior and may have limitations in providing  \\nintervention  strategies.  \\n \\nThe Basic  Behavioral  Model:  \\nThe simple  behavioral  model  comprises  four  main  factors  that inﬂuence  decision  making:  \\n \\n1. Wider  Environmental  Factors:  How  does  the country  and the world  shape  our thinking?  \\n2. Local  Environment  Factors:  How  does  our living  and working  environment  aﬀect  decision  \\nmaking?  \\n3. Social  Factors:  How  do others  subconsciously  inﬂuence  our decision  making?  \\n4. Personal  Factors:  How  do our own  mental  shortcuts  and biases  impact  decision  making?  \\n \\nEAST  Framework:  \\nThe EAST  framework  provides  four  important  aspects  for behavior  change:  \\n \\n1. Make  it Easy:  Reduce  friction  and barriers  by simplifying  messages,  using  default  options,  \\nand minimizing the hassle  factor.  \\n2. Make  it Attractive:  Capture  attention  and make  decisions  appealing  through  incentives,  \\ngamification,  or scarcity.  \\n3. Make  it Social:  Leverage  social  inﬂuence,  networks,  and social  commitments  to encourage  \\ndesired  behaviors.  \\n4. Make  it Timely:  Consider  timing,  emotional  states,  and the desire  for immediate  \\ngratification  when  prompting behavior  change.  \\n \\nMINDSPACE  Framework:  \\nThe MINDSPACE  framework  encompasses  nine  principles  for behavior  change:  \\n \\n1. Messenger:  The source  of information  greatly  inﬂuences  our response.  \\n2. Incentives:  Mental  shortcuts  determine  responses  to incentives,  which  depend  on factors  \\nlike magnitude, timing, and framing.  \\n3. Norms:  We tend  to follow  what  others  are doing,  so understanding  and leveraging  social  \\nnorms is  crucial.  \\n4. Defaults:  Pre-set options  inﬂuence  decision  making,  as people  often  accept  defaults  \\nwithout  active choices.  \\n5. Salience:  Attention  is drawn  to stimuli  that are novel,  accessible,  and simple.  \\n6. Priming:  Cues  or primes  can inﬂuence  behavior  by creating  emotional  associations.  \\n7. Aﬀect:  Emotional  associations  strongly  shape  our actions  and decision  making.  \\n8. Commitment:  Public  commitments  and consistency  with  self-image  drive  behavior.  \\n9. Ego:  We tend  to behave  in ways  that support  a positive  and consist ent self-image.  \\n \\nThe Hook  Model:  \\nThe Hook  Model,  developed  by Eyal (2014),  explains  how  products  and services  engage  \\ncustomers  through four components:  ', doc_id='1af6a716-6e16-4b83-baa0-71272a5bc17f', embedding=None, doc_hash='0c12ad392b35fce73f9752226a5d98de52ee5a0c2d10e1aea1070a05af041b1b', extra_info={'page_label': '5', 'file_name': 'cowry_merged.pdf'}),\n",

Action:  Diﬀerent  levels  of engagement,  ranging  from  simple  to deeper  interactions  with  \\nthe product or  service.  \\n3. Variable  Reward:  Providing  satisfying  outcomes  that  are unpredictable,  creating  addictive  \\nexperiences.  \\n4. Investment:  Users  investing  time  and energy  in the product  or service,  leading  to \\nincreased  ownership and  continued engagement.  \\n \\nBMAP Framework  \\nHow  it works:  \\nMotivation  - the three  drivers  of motivation  are Sensation  (the physical  level  of motivation),  \\nAnticipation (the emotional level of motivation), and Belonging (the social level of  \\nmotivation).  \\nAbility  - the simplicity  of the task.  Do users  have  all the capabilities  to complete  a task?  This \\nincludes  time,  money,  physical  and mental  eﬀort.  Furthermore,  does  the behavior  fit within  \\ntheir  social group and routine?  \\nPrompts - the triggers to enable an action. These triggers can be a Spark (the trigger that  \\ncomes  with  added  motivation),  Facilitator  (some  people  need  additional  instructions  as a \\nguide),  or Signal  (when  users  are ready  for change  and have  the required  motivation,  but \\nneed  the opportunity  to begin).  \\nBehaviors  that  are below  the action  line are most  likely  to fail due to barriers  of ability  and \\nlow motivation.  \\n \\nHow  to Use It: \\nDespite being praised for its simplicity, the model is often considered too simplistic in  \\nregards to behavior change. There is an inability to map behavior change in one domain to  \\nanother.  For example,  transferring  learning  from  training  into the workplace  or insight  from  \\ntherapy/coaching into real life. B=MAP provides a simple way of viewing behavior, where  \\nyou can increase the eﬀectiveness of design through simplicity. For example, rather than  \\nthinking about how to teach a dog new tricks that might be dif ficult, how can we make the  \\nnew tricks easier to complete? The model is especially useful when considering the use of  \\ngamification.  \\n \\nConsPros:  \\n- Cons:  \\n- The model  is often  seen  as being  too complex  and limited  in terms  of the external  \\nenvironment.  \\n- It can be difficult  to apply  to some  business  contexts.  \\n- Pros:  \\n- The model  provides  a simple  way of viewing  behavior  and designing  interventions.  \\n- It emphasizes  the importance  of motivation  and simplicity  in behavior  change.  \\n- It can be useful  in identifying  the biggest  behavioral  barriers  and providing  actionable  \\ntechniques  to overcome them.

C, O, and M inﬂuence  Behavior  (B) together.  Behavior  \\ninﬂuences these three components too, creating a feedback loop that leads to long -term  \\nbehavior.

If a process is unclear or seems overly \\ncomplex, people may avoid engaging with it. Using simple, \\nclear language and removing jargon will reduce uncertainty.Draw from an Urn\\nPeople were presented with 2 urns both containing 100 balls. \\nOne contained 50 red balls and 50 black balls. The probabilities \\nof the other one were unknown. People were asked to pick a \\nblack ball to win. The majority of participants picked from the urn \\nwhere they knew the probabilities.Ellseberg, D. (1961). Risk, \\nAmbiguity, and the Savage \\nAxioms.

We like to know how long a task is going \\nto take and what it involves as it allows us to plan more \\neffectively. We are more likely to complete a process or task if \\nour expectations are managed appropriately. We tend not to \\nmake decisions where the choices and commitments are \\nambiguous.Surgery Wait Times\\nTo investigate the role of ambiguity in our willingness to complete \\na process, experimenters looked at the role of uncertain waiting \\ntimes in doctor’s surgeries. Participants were given either a \\nspecific, realistic waiting time (e.g. 3 hours) or were told they only \\nhad to wait 10 minutes and were then periodically updated that it \\nwould be 10 minutes longer. Participants who received the \\nspecific, realistic waiting time were willing to wait significantly \\nlonger as their expectations had been effectively managed. Those \\nwho were asked to keep waiting 10 more minutes were averse to \\nthe ambiguity and thus gave up more quickly.Shah, S., Patel, A., Rumoro, D. P ., \\nHohmann, S., & Fullam, F. (2015). \\nManaging patient expectations at \\nemergency department triage. \\nPatient Experience Journal, 2(2), \\n31-44.\\nAnchoring People\\'s perceptions and judgements can be influenced by a \\nvariety of informational signals. This process is known as \\nanchoring, meaning that people become attached to the first \\npiece of information they are presented with and \\nsubconsciously use it to understand and judge all subsequent \\ninformation. Interestingly, this process occurs even when the \\ninitial information is irrelevant to the decision.Social Security Number\\nWhen asked to bid on items in an auction, participants were first \\nasked to write down the last 2 digits of their social security \\nnumber. Being anchored by this number influenced their value \\njudgement - those with higher social security numbers paid up to \\n346% more than those with lower numbers.Ariely, Dan, George Loewenstein, \\nand Drazen Prelec. 2003. \\n“‘Coherent Arbitrariness’: Stable \\nDemand Curves without Stable \\nPreferences.” Quarterly Journal \\nof Economics 118 (1): 73–106Smoke Alarms\\nA firefighting unit in the US often informs householders that they ideally \\nneed 5 smoke alarms in their house - when they were only expecting \\none to be fitted. The firefighter then suggests that it would be ok with \\nthree in this house and the householder approves this concession – \\nwhich is the right amount of smoke alarms.\\nAriely, Dan, George Loewenstein, \\nand Drazen Prelec. 2003. \\n“‘Coherent Arbitrariness’: Stable \\nDemand Curves without Stable \\nPreferences.” Quarterly Journal of \\nEconomics 118 (1): 73–106Mobile Numbers and House Prices\\nParticipants were asked to write down the last three digits of \\ntheir phone number multiplied by one thousand (e.g. 678 = \\n678,000).

We \\ntend to trust people in authoritative positions and place more \\nimportance on their opinions and contributionsElectric Shocks\\nA famous experiment showed that 65% of people administered \\npainful electric shocks to participants when instructed to do so by \\na doctor, which shows the influence that authority has on \\nbehaviour, even when this behaviour is inconsistent with our \\nvalues.Milgram, S.

It \\nturns out that most of the supermarket employees considered the store \\nbutcher to be the investment maven and would turn to him for advice. \\nThus, depending on the investment philosophy of the butcher (who \\nwas considered to be an expert in the supermarket, despite not being \\na financial expert), employees ended up heavily invested in either \\nstocks or bonds.Benartzi, S., & Thaler, R.

Interestingly, while people generally thought that \\nhaving a greater amount of choice would be more desirable, it in \\nfact impeded decision-making.

These unwritten rules are formed \\nby our perceptions of what others are doing and what they think \\nwe should be doing, driving us to conform to social \\nexpectations.Towel Reuse\\nWhen hotel guests were asked what would make them most likely \\nto reuse their towels they said “saving the environment”. \\nHowever when cards were placed in hotel rooms saying either: \\n“Help save the environment by re-suing your towel during your \\nstay”, “75% of guests in this hotel reuse their towel more than \\nonce”, or “75% of guests in this room reuse their towel more than \\nonce”. Last was most effective. A shared rare trait produces a \\nstronger sense of association and a higher likelihood of \\nconforming to social norms.Goldstein, Cialdini & Griskevicius, \\n(2008).

They then had to choose \\nthemselves. 3x likely to choose same tea as chooser. But this only \\nhappened when the chooser wasn’t in the room. Adding English to the \\npacket reduced this effect because we are less likely to be swayed by \\nsocial influences if we are already informed.Huh, Y. E., Vosgerau, J., & \\nMorewedge, C. K. (2014).

Then using actors who \\npretended to be passengers purchasing pretzels (to give the \\nimpression that lots of people were buying them), pretzel \\npurchases went up to 1 in 7. Finally when actors were used in \\naddition to a stooge walking in front of the cart, eating a \\npretzel to prime behaviour, sales increased to 1 in 6Herrman, A., Rossberg, N., \\nHuber, F., Landwehr, J.R. & \\nHenkel, S.
